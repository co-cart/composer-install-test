<h1 align="center">Install CoCart via Composer</h1>

[CoCart](https://cocart.xyz) and all it's add-ons can be installed via [composer](https://getcomposer.org/), similar to how a free plugin can be installed using [WordPress Packagist](https://wpackagist.org/). It makes it easier for developers to manage the version they wish to install and use.

## Add the Repository

Add our repository to your `composer.json` file:

```json
"repositories": [
    {
        "type":"composer",
        "url":"https://download.cocart.xyz"
    }
]
```

## Authentication

Recommend creating an `auth.json` file alongside the `composer.json` file to pass the authentication key and secret:

```json
{
	"http-basic": {
		"download.cocart.xyz": {
			"username": "somethingrandomgoeshere",
			"password": "3213464621338431778421789"
		}
	}
}
```

This way you can keep the `auth.json` file out of your version control system, keeping the username and password safe. Just make sure you create the file on your live server when you come to deploy.

## Add desired plugin

From the CLI, require your desired plugins.

### CoCart Pro

```
$ composer require cocart-plugin/cocart-pro
```

### CoCart Products - Advanced Custom Fields

```
$ composer require cocart-plugin/cocart-products-acf
```

### CoCart Products - Yoast SEO

```
$ composer require cocart-plugin/cocart-products-yoast-seo
```

## Version Constraints

You can use any Composer version constraints, or specify the exact version of a plugin or addon:

```json
"require": {
    "cocart-plugin/cocart-pro": "1.1.0"
}
```

## Example composer.json

```json
{
    "name": "cocart/composer-test.dev",
    "description": "CoCart Pro for WordPress site",
    "repositories": [
        {
            "type":"composer",
            "url":"https://download.cocart.xyz"
        }
    ],
    "require": {
        "cocart-plugin/cocart-pro": "^1.1"
    }
}
```

## Packaging

## Troubleshooting

If you are having issues with HTTP 400 Bad Request responses when running Composer commands, then you will need to update Composer on your machine with `composer self-update`.

If you are using Roots Trellis for deployments then you will need to create the `auth.json` file in the deploy hooks directory as per this [support thread](https://discourse.roots.io/t/interactive-console-authentication-for-3rd-party-repository-on-deploy/8592).
